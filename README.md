- Javascript
- JavaEE
- PHP
- Laravel
- CSS/HTML
- OracleDB
    
### Backend Engineer 1 (2018)
In the above EC company, I also was in charge of Backend. 
I created a crawler using BeautifulSoup and requests.
And the crawler prepare some feature for availability and loose coupling like this: task queue(Redis),
DB(MongoDB), console(nginx+flask)

- Redis
- nginx
- „Åï„Åè„ÇâVPS
- BeautifulSoup4
- aiohttp
- flask
- SVN
- MySQL

### AI Engineer 1 (2019-2020)
It's my first step of ML Engineer. I made an AI system using multi modal learning. The system classify
if an item is importable or not. Also, I developed the infrastructure and the API using Vue.js and flask. The system is reported by a tech-media in Japan called [PR-times](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000046.000035599.html).

#### Tools  

- Python3
- flask
- Vue.js
- sklearn
- Tensorflow
- nginx
- uWSGI
- Gitlab

#### ML models

- CNN
- naive bayes

### Data Engineer (2019 1 month)
I worked a huge telecommunication firm as an AI Engineer.
In there, I created a machine learning model for classify a bad review or not. The model was installed a new method called VAT at that time. It's a semi-supervised learning model. Also I had setup Crawler to collect data for learning with Docker.

#### Tools

- AWS(only GPU instance)
- Python3
- Pytorch
- sklearn
- flask
- nginx
- uWSGI
- Gitlab
- Docker
- Docker-compose

### AI Consultant (2019-2020)
I joined AI team as an AI consultant in a startup. 
The team is so global and all not Japanese except me.
We share the information about machine learning with the team in English.
And I made a small sentiment model as PoC.

#### Tools

- Python3
- Pandas
- Gensim
- mecab
- PostgreSQL
- word2vec
- glove

### (Sidejob) Backend Engineer 2 (2020)
Developed massive serverless crawling system. I made the system from blueprint. I had the responsible from prototype to product level and I also manage and teach the team member as tech lead. The system has great features: super easy to use, auto deploy, almost no operation toil because of serverless architecture.

#### Tools

This result is published in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15361)
  
#### Tools

- Pytorch
- nteract
- EC2
- S3

### SRE (2020-)
I have a career opportunity as DevOps and MLOps engineer. My contribution is mainly developing and operating Microservices and Serverless systems for scaling and reliability. Also, I try to make a decision of what architecture is the best or better as a first of my system architect.
